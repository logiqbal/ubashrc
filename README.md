# uBashrc

Here is a modified repository of [Useful_bashrc](https://github.com/IvanGlinkin/Useful_bashrc) to work on my docker container.

A bash terminal that displays time, inter and intranet ip addresses, working directories, list of files due to dir changes, output separation and other things that can make work easier and faster.

## Usage

Just replace the .bashrc file in the home directory

**For users**
```
rm ~/.bashrc
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logiqbal/ubashrc/main/user/.bashrc
```
or
```
mv ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.old
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logiqbal/ubashrc/main/user/.bashrc
```

**For root**
```
sudo su
rm ~/.bashrc
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logiqbal/ubashrc/main/root/.bashrc
```
or
```
sudo su
mv ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.old
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logiqbal/ubashrc/main/root/.bashrc
```
